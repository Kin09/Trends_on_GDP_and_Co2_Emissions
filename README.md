# Trends_on_GDP_and_Co2_Emissions

This project aims to analyze the environmental impact and socio-economic indicators of different countries using the "Global Country Information Dataset 2023" and "Annual change in GDP and CO₂ emissions, World" datasets. The analysis is performed using Tableau for data visualization and exploration.

## Dataset
The project utilizes two datasets: 
1. "Global Country Information Dataset 2023": This dataset provides various information about different countries, including population, GDP, CO2 emissions, birth rate, infant mortality, and more. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be found in the file "Global Country Information Dataset 2023".
2. "Annual change in GDP and CO₂ emissions, World": This dataset provides information on the annual changes in GDP and CO2 emissions globally. It is sourced from the World Bank and OECD, Our World in Data based on the Global Carbon Project. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be found in the file "Annual change in GDP and CO₂ emissions, World".

## Tableau Visualizations
The project includes several Tableau visualizations to explore and analyze the data. The main visualizations are as follows:
- Scatter Plots: Visualizing the relationships between CO2 emissions and socio-economic indicators such as infant mortality, birth rate, life expectancy, and fertility rate.
- Map: Displaying the distribution of CO2 emissions and population density across different countries.
- Bubble Chart: Comparing CO2 emissions and GDP across countries.
- Treemap: Showing the proportion of CO2 emissions based on country and population.
- Line Chart: Tracking the trends of GDP and CO2 emissions from 1961 to 2021.

## Analysis and Insights
The analysis of the data provides the following insights:
- There is a negative association between CO2 emissions and infant mortality and birth rate. As CO2 emissions decrease, infant mortality and birth rate tend to increase. However, these relationships are not statistically significant.
- There is a positive correlation between CO2 emissions and life expectancy. As CO2 emissions increase, life expectancy also tends to increase, but the relationship is not statistically significant.
- There is a negative association between CO2 emissions and fertility rate. As CO2 emissions decrease, fertility rate tends to increase, but the relationship is not statistically significant.
- GDP shows a statistically significant correlation with these indicators, suggesting its influence on socio-economic factors.

It is important to note that these findings are based on the available datasets and the specific analysis performed. Further analysis and consideration of other factors are necessary to understand the complex dynamics and potential causal relationships.

## Usage
To replicate and explore the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Download the "Global Country Information Dataset 2023" and "Annual change in GDP and CO₂ emissions, World" files.
2. Import the datasets into Tableau.
3. Open the Tableau workbook (.twb) file provided in the project.
4. Explore the different visualizations and interact with the data.

## Requirements
To run and explore the Tableau workbook, you need:
- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public (latest version)
- The "Global Country Information Dataset 2023" and "Annual change in GDP and CO₂ emissions, World" datasets.
